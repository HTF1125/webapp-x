# Market Commentary and Investment Outlook - October 2024

## Market Performance

The S&P 500 continued its impressive run in 2024, rising **2.1%** in September to bring its year-to-date gain to **22%**. This marks the fifth consecutive weekly gain for major U.S. indexes as they push further into record territory, with the S&P 500 registering its forty-third new all-time high of the year. The strong performance has been driven by three key factors:

1. A growing economy
2. A more accommodative interest rate outlook
3. Rising corporate profits

### Sector Performance

Sector performance was mixed:

- **Consumer discretionary stocks** led the way, gaining **7.4%**
- **Energy stocks** continued to struggle, down **3%** for the month and up only **6.2%** for the year
- **Utilities and Real Estate** excelled as Treasury yields declined

Small-cap stocks (Russell 2000) edged slightly higher by **0.7%**, while mid-caps returned **2.2%**, marginally outpacing large caps.

### International Markets

International markets also saw positive returns:

- Developed markets (MSCI EAFE) gained **0.6%**
- Emerging markets (MSCI EM) jumped **6.5%**, aided by Chinese stimulus measures

## Fixed Income Markets

The bond market continued its positive trend, with the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index gaining **1.3%** in September, bringing its return for 2024 to **4.45%**. Key developments include:

- The **10-year Treasury yield** declined from **3.91%** to **3.74%** during September
- Yields on the **2-year Treasury** dropped from **3.93%** to **3.62%**
- Investment grade (IG) corporate bonds led fixed income returns, benefiting from declining yields and modest spread tightening

## Federal Reserve Policy

In a significant policy shift, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by **50 basis points** in September, bringing the federal funds rate to a range of **4.75% to 5%**. This marks the Fed's first rate cut since 2020. Key points:

- The Fed opted for a bolder **50 bps cut** instead of the expected **25 bps**
- Officials are targeting quarter-point rate reductions in both November and December
- Fed Chair Jerome Powell expressed growing confidence in maintaining labor market strength while bringing inflation down to the **2% target**

## Economic Indicators

Despite some mixed signals, the overall economic picture remains positive:

- The labor market remains robust, with employers adding **254,000 jobs** in September, nearly double expectations
- August inflation data showed headline CPI slowing to **2.5% year-over-year**, its slowest pace in two-and-a-half years
- Core CPI, excluding food and energy prices, rose **3.2%**, matching July for the slowest pace since April 2021
- Retail sales rose faster than expected in September

## Geopolitical Developments

Geopolitical tensions have increased, particularly in the Middle East:

- Escalating tensions between Israel and Iran are fueling fears of a broader Middle East conflict and potential disruptions to Iranian oil exports
- The resolution of a political dispute in Libya briefly cut its oil exports in half
- Ongoing concerns about the effectiveness of stimulus measures in China

## Investment Outlook

While the market's strong performance in 2024 is encouraging, investors should be mindful of potential risks:

- Geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East
- Potential for renewed inflationary pressures
- Uncertainty surrounding the upcoming U.S. elections
- Signs of looming weakness in the global semiconductor sector

Investors should maintain a diversified portfolio aligned with their long-term goals and risk tolerance. Consider:

- Exposure to other asset classes and regions that have lagged, such as international equities and small-cap stocks
- The potential benefits of bonds, which have shown strong performance in recent months
- Staying invested rather than holding excess cash, as demonstrated by the strong returns across asset classes over the past 12 months

As we enter the final quarter of 2024, markets will likely remain focused on Fed policy, economic data, and geopolitical developments. While challenges persist, the overall economic picture remains supportive of further, albeit potentially more moderate, gains.
